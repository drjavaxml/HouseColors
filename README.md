A Python and Streamlit app that lets you upload a picture of a house or room and paint it with known paint colors from major dealers or create your own colors.
It allows you to click on any color and then substitute another. It allows you to download the "painted house".
It is easier to use than most of the online apps that only allow you to draw polygons.
